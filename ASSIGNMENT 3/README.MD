Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.
Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user

Various Debugging Methods:
1. Debugging a Node.js application that uses nodemon
2. Debug with V8 Debugging Protocol
3. Debug with Chrome Debugging Protocol

2.MVC

MVC is abbreviated as "Model View Controller" is a design pattern created for developing applications specifically web applications. As the name suggests, it has three major parts. The traditional software design pattern works in an "Input Process Output" pattern whereas MVC works as "Controller -Model - View" approach. 


The application and its development are divided into three interconnected parts.

1. Model:  Model represents the structure of data, the format and the constraints with which it is stored. It maintains the data of the application. Essentially, it is the database part of the application.

2. View: View is what is presented to the user. Views utilize the Model and present data in a form in which the user wants. A user can also be allowed to make changes to the data presented to the user. They consist of static and dynamic pages which are rendered or sent to the user when the user requests them.

3. Controller: Controller controls the requests of the user and then generates appropriate response which is fed to the viewer. Typically, the user interacts with the View, which in turn generates the appropriate request, this request will be handled by a controller. The controller renders the appropriate view with the model data as a response.

Advantages:
1. Faster Development Process
2. Ability To Provide Multiple Views
3. Support For Asynchronous Technique
4. Modification Does Not Affect The Entire Model
5. MVC Model Returns The Data Without Formatting
6. SEO Friendly Development Platform
